# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Goal
- The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of 
  earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
- It use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates 
  and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.
- In this project we use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the 
  earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We then use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an 
  API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.


## Results
The results of the analysis was deployed on a webpage using html and javascript. The interactive webpage can be found here: https://dshetty100.github.io/Plotly_Bellybutton_Biodiversity/
